<h1>PHP Pipes</h1>

<p>Firstly, I know this is hideous. I'm working on it. Apologies.</p>

<p>Secondly, welcome to the Pipes website! Pipes is a clear, easy to use and sophisticated PHP package management tool. Gone are the days of downloading cruddy old zips and maintaining your libraries one by one. Gone are the days of relying on PEAR or any other hideous, archaic, old messy tools. Pipes is awesome.</p>
